ILOYALTY SYSTEMS â€“ AI BASED CUSTOMER RENTENTION SYSTEM
University Research and Development Project 
iLoyalty System is a research and development project about an ai-based customer retention system for small businesses with large collections of data. This research involves cloud automation, ai integration (churn predictions) and customer retention systems applications. The idea is to migrate all the data collections in cloud, mine data for machine learning, predict customer churns and apply customer retention solutions on the business information systems.
